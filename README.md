# Merge-Insert Sort Implementation

This project implements the merge-insert sort algorithm, specifically utilizing the Ford-Johnson algorithm.

## Overview
The implementation was carried out using both `vector` and `list` data structures from the C++ Standard Library. By leveraging the characteristics of these data structures, the execution time of the algorithm was compared:
- With `vector` which allows random access to any element.
- With `list` which does not support random access.
